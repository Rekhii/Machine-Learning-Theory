#  Machine Learning Theory â€” From Scratch

> **Goal:** Build a complete, research-grade collection of machine learning algorithms **from first principles** â€” fully coded from scratch in Python, with mathematical intuition, derivations, and experiments.

##  Vision

Modern AI systems rely on deep abstractions built atop decades of mathematical theory and algorithmic innovation.  
This project aims to **reconstruct that foundation from the ground up**, experimenting with each algorithm to deeply internalize its mechanics â€” not just to use it, but to **reinvent it**.

Every notebook here reflects:
- A direct mathematical derivation â†’ from formula to functional code  
- A clean, minimal implementation (no sklearn black-boxing)  
- Empirical verification on synthetic or real datasets  
- Notes, intuitions, and edge-case behaviors observed during experimentation

## ðŸ§© Technical Stack

- **Python + NumPy** (no sklearn during core derivations)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Colab / Jupyter** environment for experimentation  
- **Optional:** `scikit-learn` used only for result verification

## Methodology

1. **Mathematical Foundation:**  
   Each notebook begins with derivation of the loss function, gradient, or objective.

2. **Code From Scratch:**  
   Implementation without prebuilt ML functions â€” only base NumPy ops.

3. **Empirical Verification:**  
   Run synthetic or real datasets to visualize convergence, boundary, and error dynamics.

4. **Comparative Check:**  
   Validate against scikit-learn or PyTorch equivalents for sanity.

##  Philosophy


Understanding each algorithm from its mathematical essence cultivates research intuition â€” the ability to derive, modify, and invent new methods beyond existing literature.
